# Indoor AR Navigation
 A new Indoor AR Navigation project.
 The project is a rethinking and refactoring of OldIndoorNav.
 In the current version, map view and AR mode are separated and completely independent.
 It is supposed to use Unity only to display the route in AR, the main interaction is carried out through the interface created in Android Studio.
